# JSX Rules Exercise

In this exercise, you will learn and apply the core rules of writing JSX in React.

---

## Step 1: Create a New Component

1. **Create a New File**  
   - Create a new file named `JSXRules.jsx`.

2. **Write the Component**  
   - Inside this file, write a functional component named `JSXRules`.

3. **Component Requirements**  
   - The component should return a `<div>` containing the following:
     - A `<h1>` element with the text **"JSX Rules"**.
     - A paragraph (`<p>`) listing at least 3 rules of JSX:
       1. JSX must return a single parent element.
       2. JSX elements must be properly closed.
       3. JSX attributes are written using camelCase (e.g., `className` instead of `class`).
